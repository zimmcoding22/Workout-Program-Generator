# Workout Program Generator

## Description

Designed as a tool for a fitness coach to put together a customized workout plan for an athlete/client. Rather than spending ~15 minutes free writing a plan, a user can automatically generate an excel spreadsheet displaying which exercises to integrate along with how many repetitions/sets to perform, and then forward the generated spreadsheet as an email attachment. The application is written in Java, uses Java Swing as a simple interface, and relies on Apache POI and JavaMail to create and email spreadsheets.
