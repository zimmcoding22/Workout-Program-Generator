# Workout Program Generator

## Description

This tool was designed as an easy method for a strength coach to put together a customized workout plan for an athlete or client. Rather than spending 10-15 minutes free writing the plan, users can automatically generate an excel spreadsheet displaying which exercises to integrate along with how many repetitions/sets to perform, and then it forwards the generated spreadsheet as an email attachment. The application is written in Java, uses Java Swing as a simple interface, and relies on Apache POI and JavaMail to create and send spreadsheets.
